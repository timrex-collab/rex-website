✅ Result: ## Deployment Configuration Fix and Contact Form Analysis

Primary Issue Resolved
The Netlify deployment error was caused by an incorrect publish directory configuration. The site was configured to deploy from puplic (a typo), but the build process outputs static files to dist/public.

The netlify.toml configuration file was updated to specify the correct publish directory path:

Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist/public (corrected from the misconfigured puplic)
This change ensures that when the build completes successfully, Netlify will find the static files in the correct location and deploy them properly.

Build Verification
The build process was tested and completes successfully:

Vite builds the frontend React application
Output includes all static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
Total of 1,727 modules transformed
Frontend bundle size: ~414 KB (133 KB gzipped)
Backend server bundle: ~8.6 KB
The build generates two main outputs:

dist/index.js - Express backend server
dist/public/ - Static frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets)
Contact Form Architecture Review
The contact form implementation was thoroughly analyzed:

Frontend Components (client/src/components/ContactForm.tsx):

Form includes fields for name, email, phone, and message
Supports image uploads (up to 5 images, max 5MB each)
Validates file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP only)
Implements honeypot field for spam prevention
Provides user feedback via toast notifications
Posts form data to /api/contact endpoint
Backend API (server/routes.ts):

Express route handler at POST /api/contact
Uses Multer for multipart form data and file uploads
Validates form data using Zod schema (shared/schema.ts)
Implements honeypot spam detection
Sends emails via Resend API
Email recipient configured to: tim.rex@gmx.de
Includes uploaded images as email attachments
Requires RESEND_API_KEY environment variable
Form Validation:

Name: required, minimum 1 character
Email: required, valid email format
Phone: optional
Message: required, minimum 10 characters
Honeypot: optional (should remain empty)
Important Deployment Considerations
This application uses a full-stack architecture with Express backend. For the contact form to function properly in production on Netlify, one of the following approaches is needed:

Deploy backend separately: Host the Express server (dist/index.js) on a platform that supports Node.js servers (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Render) and update the frontend API calls to point to the backend URL.

Convert to Netlify Functions: Refactor the Express API routes into Netlify serverless functions in the netlify/functions/ directory.

Use alternative form handling: Consider using Netlify Forms (built-in) or a third-party form service if serverless functions are not preferred.

The current build only deploys the static frontend to Netlify. The backend Express server at /api/contact will not be available unless deployed using one of the approaches above.

Environment Variables Required
For the contact form to send emails successfully, the following environment variable must be configured in Netlify:

RESEND_API_KEY - API key for the Resend email service
